## Abstract
A simple algorithm is provided for randomly sampling a set of _N+1_ weights such that their sum is constrained to be equal to one, analogous to randomly subdividing a pie into _N+1_ slices where the probability distribution of slice volumes are identically distributed. The cumulative density and probability density functions of the random weights are provided. The algorithmic implementation for the random number sampling are made available. This algorithm has potential applications in calibration, uncertainty analysis, and sensitivity analysis of environmental models. The associated journal publication provides three example applications to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method compared to alternative sampling methods. Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/julemai/PieShareDistribution/wiki) for more details and documentation.
