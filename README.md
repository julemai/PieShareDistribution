## Abstract
A simple algorithm is provided for randomly sampling a set of N+1 weights such that their sum is constrained to be equal to one, analogous to randomly subdividing a pie into N+1 slices where the probability distribution of slice volumes are identically distributed. The cumulative density and probability density functions of the random weights are provided. Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/julemai/PieShareDistribution/wiki) for more details and documentation.

## Usage
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/julemai/PieShareDistribution/wiki) for details on the usage in [Python](https://github.com/julemai/PieShareDistribution/wiki/Python) and [R](https://github.com/julemai/PieShareDistribution/wiki/R).
